# My First eCommerce Web Project

## Overview
This is my first eCommerce web project developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, and SQLite. The project served as an introductory experience to gain hands-on skills in web development.

## Advantages:
- There are dynamic HTML pages for dynamically displaying laptops.
- Effectively stores products in the database.
- Survey-based filtering for products.
- Products are visually appealing.
- I organized my files as a developer, and while it's not perfect, it's good for the level of a freshman student.

## Limitations:
- Doesn't have an official routing system.
- Incomplete authentication system (Only admin can add products).


## Based on each survey response you get different results.
