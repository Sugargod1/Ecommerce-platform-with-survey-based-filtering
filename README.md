# Laptop Ecommerce platform 
My first Web Ecommerce project by using HTML, CSS, JS, Django, SQLite. It was very introductory project to gain hands on experience.

## Advantages:
There are dynamic html's for dynamically show up laptops. 
Effectively store products in the database.
Survey based filtering products.
Products are visually appealing.
I organized my files as a developer, and while it's not perfect, it's good for the level of a freshman student.
## Disadvantages:
Don't have official routing system.
It has incomplete authentication system. (Only admin can add products)
