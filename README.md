# Laptop Ecommerce Platform

My first Web Ecommerce project by using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS**, **Django**, and **SQLite**. It was a very introductory project to gain hands-on experience I have finished this project while I was freshman.

## Advantages:
- There are dynamic HTML pages for dynamically displaying laptops.
- Effectively stores products in the database.
- Survey-based filtering for products.
- Products are visually appealing.
- I organized my files as a developer, and while it's not perfect, it's good for the level of a freshman student.

## Disadvantages:
- Doesn't have an official routing system.
- Incomplete authentication system (Only admin can add products).
